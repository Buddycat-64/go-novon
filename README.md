A decentralised video streaming host client to stream RTMP to novon

# Prerequisites

- ffmpeg: https://ffmpeg.org/
- Golang: https://go.dev/ (version 1.21 or above)

# Building from source

1) install the latest go
2) build the app: ```go build -o ./gonovon ./cmd/cli```
3) run ```./gonovon```

# Video bitrate, codecs, encoding configuration

Generally the same as all major streaming platforms, stick to h264 codecs for compatibility.
Set your keyframe to 2s for a good balance between fast delivery and efficiency.
High quality fast moving streams of 1080p 60hz should aim for a 6000kbps video bitrate.

Generally lower bitrates provide faster delivery, and allow for more viewers, lower the bitrate if buffering is an issue, or if your source media does not require these high bitrate for a good representation to improve viewer experience.

# Streaming with OBS

- Settings -> Stream
  - Service: Custom
  - Server: the location of the running gonovon application, if its on the same machine as your OBS application this would be "http://127.0.0.1" or "http://localhost/"
  - Stream Key: "novon" (this is not displayed on novon.tv but is required and can be used to utilize more features MediaMTX has to offer
- Settings -> Output -> Streaming
  - Video Encoder: x264 or if you have a recent NVIDIA GPU: NVIDIA NVENC H.264
  - Keyframe interval: 2s (you have to go into the advanced menu to change this)
  - Refer to the previous paragraph for more info on bitrate, codecs, and encoding configuration.

Once go-novon is up and running you can at any time start and stop your stream.


# Dependencies
- MediaMTX - [https://github.com/bluenviron/mediamtx/](https://github.com/bluenviron/mediamtx/) [MIT license]

  A fork of MediaMTX is encapsulated to host the RTMP server and mux the stream to MPEG-TS segments for delivery

- nkn-sdk-go - [https://github.com/nknorg/nkn-sdk-go](https://github.com/nknorg/nkn-sdk-go) [Apache-2.0 license]

  The nkn network is used to amplify and distribute your video stream by multicasting; minimizing bandwidth requirements for the host while being able to reach a large number of viewers (you DO NOT need to download the .ZIP from the nkn SDK github as all dependencies are included in the binary, you do however need to install FFMPEG seperatley)



# Setup

First you will want to install OBS studio for your platform (https://obsproject.com/download)

Then you will want to configure OBS as shown above
(you will also want to add "Display Capture" as a source on OBS to actually record your screen)

Then Download the GoNovon .EXE from the releases (or build it yourself)

Run the binary (.exe) and hit "Start GoNovon"

Then as the last step click "Start Streaming" in the OBS UI, and you should be good to go!<img width="914" height="322" alt="OBS stream" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dd43c6e1-f7f5-4cd8-9b8e-f46266ea7569" />
